#source('/Users/noah/src/boundary/git-math/gitMath.R')
#gs <- mkchurnline()    #lines, churn, churn/lines
#OR
#mkreport()             #generates report of top values, all and a plot of top values
#gitMathAll.txt and gitMathtop.txt is created in current working directory
#also creates pdf called topchurn.pdf
```
